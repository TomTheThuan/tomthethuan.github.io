As a scientific discipline, like other traditional science subjects, physics is a discipline that focuses on studying matter, energy, space, and time; Biology is a discipline that focuses on studying life related topics; Chemistry is a discipline that studies the composition and changes of substances; Similarly, computer science is a specialized discipline that studies everything related to electronic devices.\nThe content of computer science is actually very extensive, and all things related to electronic devices in modern society are related to computer science. For example, the software we usually use is classify under the categories of “software” and “programming”, and the mobile phones and computers we use belong to the category of “hardware”. In addition to these “common things” that can be encountered in daily life, computer science often appears in many fields that ordinary people do not easily notice, such as network security, data analysis, artificial intelligence, software engineering, security and cryptography, algorithms and logic, and so on. So since there are so many fields to learn, what should we start from?\nI cannot be said to be a genius in the field of computer science, but I still have more knowledge than my classmates. Before I truly systematically studied computer science, I had been exposed to a lot of related knowledge, such as basic binary, file systems, code writing, and so on. And this knowledge comes from some of my personal hobbies - I like to play with computers. I like computers not only because of the games on them, nor because of the good TV, but purely because I enjoy trying different things on the computer that I haven’t tried before. Sometimes, I may struggle for hours or even days over a sudden idea come to my head, and through the cycle of failures and problem-solving, I gradually become familiar with everything I come into contact with. In the past two years, I have been exposed to almost all the content related to the course outline. Although I have not systematically studied it or deliberately advanced it, all the knowledge points I have learned can find more destinations in the content I have been exposed to before.\nSome people might think that my description is too exaggerated, but it is actually very simple and clear. Compared to several other scientific disciplines, computer science is considered the latest one. Given its special properties, the contents we are learning now is very basic: some seemingly complex knowledge points will become very simple after sorting them out. To understand a knowledge point, one only needs to remember its causal relationship, which is a point that many beginners who have completely different understandings do not understand. Therefore, I believe that as an educator, teachers can try to start from a very basic problem and gradually introduce many knowledge points, using a case study to extend to a general scenario, and draw inferences. This is what I have learned through the process of constantly making mistakes and correcting - I once felt scared because of a knowledge that I had never seen before, worried that I would rack my brains and not understand it, and didn’t want to take many detours in this matter, wasting time and energy. Because I have experienced a feeling of powerlessness towards knowledge, I do not want others to repeat my mistakes.\nIn order to help people with similar experiences as me, I often help classmates who are in difficulty and help them answer some unclear knowledge. In fact, some people don’t understand the problem not because the knowledge point are too difficult, but because they haven’t combined the scattered knowledge points they have learned together. What I have done for them is to explain the knowledge taught in class in detail, and explain the fields they don’t understand. Perhaps because many of the knowledge points are self-learning, I can roughly understand where others are facing difficulties, and also know how to explain and understand this knowledge point in my own way. I hope to continue making contributions from others in my future studies, because to be fair, these knowledge points are clear but not simple, and it takes a lot of time to fully master them on my own. So, in order to create a more efficient learning environment, I believe that students who are also studying this subject can help each other, answer questions they don’t understand, and absorb the ideas of others.\nMy relationship with computer science can be roughly divided into three stages, from the first stage of complete misunderstanding to gradually understanding the essence of computer science through continuous active learning. Then, while learning new knowledge, consolidate the previous knowledge points by answering questions to others. This learning cycle has enabled me to achieve successes in the field of computer science, and I believe that this learning cycle can also be applied to other subjects, allowing me to progress in other subjects.\n",
